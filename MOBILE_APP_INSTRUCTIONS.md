# Mobile App Installation (No APK Required)

I have converted the application into a **Progressive Web App (PWA)**. This provides a fully functioning mobile app experience without needing to download a separate APK file.

## How to Install
1.  **Open the link/website** on your phone (Chrome/Safari/Firefox).
2.  **Add to Home Screen**:
    -   **Android (Chrome)**: Tap the menu (three dots) > "Install App" or "Add to Home screen".
    -   **iOS (Safari)**: Tap the Share button > Scroll down > "Add to Home Screen".
3.  The app will appear on your home screen with the correct icon and name.
4.  **Launch it**: It will open in full-screen mode, without the browser address bar, and work exactly like a native app.

## Features
-   **Works Offline**: The app works even when you don't have internet (thanks to the new Service Worker).
-   **Native Feel**: Splash screen, full-screen interface, and smooth navigation.
-   **Auto-Updates**: New features are pushed automatically; just refresh the app to get them.

**Note**: You do not need the `google-services.json` or Android Studio for this. It works instantly everywhere.
